      [
        - Developed an end-to-end #link("https://chatterbugs.app")[web application] link designed to seamlessly complement existing physical card decks sold by the client, enhancing user engagement and product experience.
        - Enabled secure, user-specific access by integrating a unique 6-digit code linked to each purchased physical deck, unlocking tailored digital content upon verification and payment.
        - Engineered direct content access through QR codes printed on each physical card, allowing users instant digital navigation to corresponding audio content within the web app.
        - Led full-stack development lifecycle, including technology stack selection, database architecture, data storage solutions, and infrastructure hosting.
        - Implemented frontend using Next.js, providing an intuitive, performant, and responsive user interface.
        - Designed a robust authentication solution with Firebase Authentication, enhanced through custom server-side blocking functions to append additional JWT claims via Firebase Cloud Functions.
        - Built a secure and scalable backend with PostgreSQL, exposing data through a GraphQL API powered by Hasura. Ensured secure access control by leveraging the custom JWT claims added while authentication
        - Developed specialized backend services using Rust with Axum, strategically chosen for superior performance and memory efficiency on resource-constrained environments (hosted effectively on a 1GB RAM DigitalOcean droplet), significantly outperforming alternatives like TypeScript or Python.
        - Extended server functionalities by implementing Hasura Actions and Event triggers directly within the Rust-based Axum server, enhancing operational efficiency and responsiveness.
        - Automated deployment pipelines and database migrations using GitHub Actions, streamlining continuous integration and delivery processes for Hasura and Rust services.

        - Joined as a frontend engineer, working on the #link("https://github.com/questbook/grants-frontend")[grants tool] frontend
        - Worked on the #link("https://github.com/questbook/grants-contracts-upgradeable")[set of smart contracts] that power the Questbook #link("https://github.com/questbook/grants-frontend")[grants tool]
        - Added and modified handlers for the #link("https://github.com/questbook/subgraph")[subgraph] that indexed the events emitted by the above contracts. The data was queried from the frontend using a GraphQL API, that was exposed by the same subgraph node.
        - Maintained the graph node for subgraph deployment on four chains
        - Developed a #link("https://github.com/questbook/qb-api")[Serverless API endpoint] that could be used to poll data periodically by #link("https://zapier.com/")[Zapier] and be used by other apps
        - Built an #link("https://github.com/questbook/communication-service")[email notification service] using #link("https://www.serverless.com/")[Serverless], for Questbook users. It would poll the subgraph at specific intervals and send out emails based on new and modified data
        - Created a #link("https://t.me/qb_notif_bot")[Telegram bot] for user action notifications. It comprised a webhook, where the Telegram server sent new subscription requests and a cron job that sent out periodic notifications based on a pub-sub architecture
        - Acquired experience with AWS Lambda while deploying serverless apps, AWS Elastic Beanstalk for graph node management, and AWS CloudWatch for debugging
